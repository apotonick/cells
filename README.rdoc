= Cells

<em>View Components for Rails.</em>

== Overview

Say you're writing a Rails online shop - the shopping cart is reappearing again and again in every view. You're thinking about a clean solution for that part. A mixture of controller code, before-filters, partials and helpers?

No. That sucks. Take Cells.

Cells are View Components for Rails. They look and feel like controllers. They don't have no +DoubleRenderError+. They can be rendered everywhere in your controllers or views. They are cacheable, testable, fast and wonderful. They bring back OOP to your view and improve your software design.

And the best: You can have as many cells in your page as you need!

== Installation

It's a gem!

Rails 3:

  gem install cells

Rails 2.3:

  gem install cells -v 3.3.5


== Generate

Creating a cell is nothing more than

  $ rails generate cells:cell ShoppingCart display
    create  app/cells/
    create  app/cells/shopping_cart
    create  app/cells/shopping_cart_cell.rb
    create  app/cells/shopping_cart/display.html.erb
    create  test/cells/shopping_cart_test.rb

That looks very familiar.

== Render the cell

Now, render your cart. Why not put it in <tt>layouts/application.html.erb</tt> for now? 

  <div id="header">
    <%= render_cell :shopping_cart, :display, :user => @current_user %>

Feels like rendering a controller action. As additional encapsulation we pass the current +user+ from outside. Call it knowledge hiding.

== Code

Time to improve our cell code. Let's start with <tt>app/cells/shopping_cart_cell.rb</tt>:

  class ShoppingCartCell < Cell::Rails 
    def display 
      user    = @opts[:user]        # @opts exposes options passed to #render_cell.
      @items  = user.items_in_cart
      
      render  # renders display.html.erb
    end
  end

Is that a controller? Hell, yeah. We even got a +render+ method as we know it from the good ol' +ActionController+.


== Views

Since a plain call to +render+ will start rendering <tt>app/cells/shopping_cart/display.html.erb</tt> we should put some meaningful markup there.

  <div id="cart">
    You have <%= @items.size %> items in your shopping cart. 
  </div>
  
=== Haml? Builder?

Yes, Cells support all template types that are supported by Rails itself. Remember- it's a controller!

=== Helpers

Yes, Cells have helpers just like controllers. If you need some specific helper, do

  class ShoppingCartCell < Cell::Rails 
    helper MyExtraHelper

and it will be around in your cart views.

=== Partials?

Yeah, we do support rendering partials in views. Nevertheless, we discourage _partials_ at all.

The distinction between partials and views is making things more complex, so why should we have two kinds of view types? Use ordinary views instead, they're fine.

  %p
    = render :view => 'items'


== View Inheritance

This is where OOP comes back to your view.

* <b>Inherit code</b> into your cells by deriving more abstract cells.
* <b>Inherit views</b> from ancesting cells.

=== Builders

Let +render_cell+ take care of creating the right cell. Just configure your super-cell properly.

  class LoginCell < Cell::Rails
    build do
      UnauthorizedUserCell unless logged_in?
    end
  
A call to

  render_cell(:login, :box)

will render the configured +UnauthorizedUserCell+ instead of the original +LoginCell+ if the login test fails.


== Caching

Cells do strict view caching. No cluttered fragment caching. Add

  class ShoppingCartCell < Cell::Rails 
    cache :display, :expires_in => 10.minutes

and your cart will be re-rendered after 10 minutes.

There are multiple advanced options for expiring your view caches, including an expiration lambda.

  class ShoppingCartCell < Cell::Rails 
    cache :display do |cell|
      Item.still_valid?
    end


== Testing

Another big advantage compared to monolithic controller/helper/partial piles is the ability to test your cells isolated.

=== Test::Unit

So what if you wanna test the cart cell? Use the generated <tt>test/cells/shopping_cart_cell_test.rb</tt> test.

  class ShoppingCartCellTest < Cell::TestCase
    test "display" do
      invoke :display, :user => @user_fixture
      assert_select "#cart", "You have 3 items in your shopping cart."
    end

Run your tests with

  $ rake test:cells

That's easy, clean and strongly improves your component-driven software quality. How'd you do that with partials?


=== RSpec

If you prefer RSpec examples, use the {rspec-cells}[http://github.com/apotonick/rspec-cells] gem for specing.

  it "should render the posts count" do
    render_cell(:posts, :count).should have_selector("p", :content => "4 posts!")
  end

To run your specs we got a rake task, too!

  $ rake spec:cells


== Rails 2.3 note

In order to copy the cells rake tasks to your app, run

  $ script/generate cells_install


== More features

Cells can do more.

<b>No Limits</b>::  Have as many cells in your page as you need - no limitation to your +render_cell+ calls.
<b>View Inheritance</b>::  Inherit view files dynamically from parent cells.
<b>Cell Nesting</b>:: Have complex cell hierarchies as you can call +render_cell+ within cells, too. 

Go for it, you'll love it!
