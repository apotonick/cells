    # Adds a builder to the cell class. Builders are used in #render_cell to find out the concrete
    # class for rendering. This is helpful if you frequently want to render subclasses according
    # to different circumstances (e.g. login situations) and you don't want to place these deciders in
    # your view code.
    #
    # Passes the opts hash from #render_cell into the block. The block is executed in controller context. 
    # Multiple build blocks are ORed, if no builder matches the building cell is used.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    # Consider two different user box cells in your app.
    #
    #   class AuthorizedUserBox < UserInfoBox
    #   end
    #
    #   class AdminUserBox < UserInfoBox
    #   end
    #
    # Now you don't want to have deciders all over your views - use a declarative builder.
    #
    #   UserInfoBox.build do |opts|
    #     AuthorizedUserBox if user_signed_in?
    #     AdminUserBox if admin_signed_in?
    #   end
    #
    # In your view #render_cell will instantiate the right cell for you now.
