Description:
  Stubs out a new cell and its views. Pass the cell name, either
  CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments.

  This generates a cell class in app/cells and view templates in
  app/cells/cell_name.

Examples:

  rails g cells:cell ShoppingCart index --haml

  This will create these cell assets:
    Cell:
      app/cells/shopping_cart_cell.rb
    Views:
      app/cells/shopping_cart/index.html.haml
    Test:
      test/cells/shopping_cart_cell_test
